# Melonama Detection Assignment
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project?
  This project is about building a machine learning model to detect melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, from images. The goal is to create a tool that      can help doctors by automatically identifying signs of melanoma, saving time and reducing errors.
  
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  This project is about building a machine learning model to detect melanoma, a dangerous type of skin cancer, from images. The goal is to create a tool that      can help doctors by automatically identifying signs of melanoma, saving time and reducing errors.
  
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  The dataset consists of 2,357 images of different skin conditions, including melanoma, sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). It     contains images of both malignant and benign skin diseases, sorted into categories like melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and others.


## Conclusions
-  The final model demonstrates a significant improvement in both training and validation performance compared to Model 1 and Model 2.
-  The inclusion of data augmentation, batch normalization, and regularization (L2) helped to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting.
-  Training accuracy increased to 96%, with a corresponding validation accuracy of 86%, indicating better model stability and performance on unseen data.
-  The addition of dropout layers further prevented overfitting, as evidenced by the reduction in validation loss to 0.45, compared to higher losses in previous models.
-  Overall, the model is now well-optimized for classification tasks.
